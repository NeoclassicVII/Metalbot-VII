# How to use?

The libraries you need:
- requests
- webbrowser
- wikipedia
- bs4
- youtube_dl
- lyricsgenius
- pyfiglet
- difflib
- colorama
- youtubesearchpython

You also need to install FFmpeg. 
Here is a tutorial for that: https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/

Requirements.txt added! Now you can just run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" and install all modules and libraries! Then you will have to download FFmpeg (see tutorial above) and that's it! 

I am planning to convert the whole program to .exe so that you don't have to install anything but the program itself. 

If you need some help with libraries or if you have problems - contact me!
